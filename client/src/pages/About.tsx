            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Serene Healing was founded in 2010 by Sarah Johnson after her own transformative journey with holistic healing practices. Following a personal health crisis that conventional medicine couldn't fully address, Sarah discovered the profound impact of integrative healing modalities.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              After experiencing firsthand the transformative power of sound healing, crystal therapy, aromatherapy, and mindfulness meditation, Sarah committed herself to extensive training in these practices. Her vision was to create a sanctuary where others could find the same healing and balance she discovered.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Today, Serene Healing has grown into a respected wellness center, helping hundreds of clients reconnect with their innate capacity for healing and wellbeing.
